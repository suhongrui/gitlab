# Contributing

First of all, thank you!  I hope you find it worthwhile to help out with Sidekiq.

## Issues

When opening an issue, please include a **backtrace** with your error.

## Code

If you're interested in helping or contributing to Sidekiq, here's
some known areas which need improvement:

* The Web UI and sidekiq.org website could always use more polish.  If you have an eye for design and an idea for improvement, please open an issue and let us know.
* The [Sidekiq issue tracker](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues) usually has a few ideas
* Your brilliant idea which I haven't listed!

It's always best to open an issue before investing a lot of time into a
fix or new functionality.  Functionality must meet my design goals and
vision for the project to be accepted; I would be happy to discuss how
your idea can best fit into Sidekiq.

## Legal

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or
claims to any changes submitted to the Sidekiq project and assign the copyright of
those changes to Contributed Systems LLC.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment
contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR.
Open an issue and someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a PR to us, that code becomes ours".
99.9% of the time that's what you intend anyways; we hope it doesn't scare you away from contributing!
