        #
        #  :max_size ::
        #    An integer specifying the maximum byte size of a file before a it
        #    will be treated as binary. The default value is 512MB.
        #
        #  :context_lines ::
        #    The number of unchanged lines that define the boundary of a hunk
        #    (and to display before and after the actual changes). The default is
        #    3.
        #
        #  :interhunk_lines ::
        #    The maximum number of unchanged lines between hunk boundaries before
        #    the hunks will be merged into a one. The default is 0.
        #
        #  :old_prefix ::
        #    The virtual "directory" to prefix to old filenames in hunk headers.
        #    The default is "a".
        #
        #  :new_prefix ::
        #    The virtual "directory" to prefix to new filenames in hunk headers.
        #    The default is "b".
        #
        #  :reverse ::
        #    If true, the sides of the diff will be reversed.
        #
        #  :force_text ::
        #    If true, all files will be treated as text, disabling binary
        #    attributes & detection.
        #
        #  :ignore_whitespace ::
        #    If true, all whitespace will be ignored.
        #
        #  :ignore_whitespace_change ::
        #    If true, changes in amount of whitespace will be ignored.
        #
        #  :ignore_whitespace_eol ::
        #    If true, whitespace at end of line will be ignored.
        #
        #  :ignore_submodules ::
        #    if true, submodules will be excluded from the diff completely.
        #
        #  :patience ::
        #    If true, the "patience diff" algorithm will be used (currenlty
        #    unimplemented).
        #
        #  :include_ignored ::
        #    If true, ignored files will be included in the diff.
        #
        #  :include_untracked ::
        #   If true, untracked files will be included in the diff.
        #
        #  :include_unmodified ::
        #    If true, unmodified files will be included in the diff.
        #
        #  :recurse_untracked_dirs ::
        #    Even if +:include_untracked+ is true, untracked directories will
        #    only be marked with a single entry in the diff. If this flag is set
        #    to true, all files under ignored directories will be included in the
        #    diff, too.
        #
        #  :disable_pathspec_match ::
        #    If true, the given +*paths+ will be applied as exact matches,
        #    instead of as fnmatch patterns.
        #
        #  :deltas_are_icase ::
        #    If true, filename comparisons will be made with case-insensitivity.
        #
        #  :include_untracked_content ::
        #    if true, untracked content will be contained in the the diff patch
        #    text.
        #
        #  :skip_binary_check ::
        #    If true, diff deltas will be generated without spending time on
        #    binary detection. This is useful to improve performance in cases
        #    where the actual file content difference is not needed.
        #
        #  :include_typechange ::
        #    If true, type changes for files will not be interpreted as deletion
        #    of the "old file" and addition of the "new file", but will generate
        #    typechange records.
        #
        #  :include_typechange_trees ::
        #    Even if +:include_typechange+ is true, blob -> tree changes will
        #    still usually be handled as a deletion of the blob. If this flag is
        #    set to true, blob -> tree changes will be marked as typechanges.
        #
        #  :ignore_filemode ::
        #    If true, file mode changes will be ignored.
        #
        #  :recurse_ignored_dirs ::
        #    Even if +:include_ignored+ is true, ignored directories will only be
        #    marked with a single entry in the diff. If this flag is set to true,
        #    all files under ignored directories will be included in the diff,
        #    too.
